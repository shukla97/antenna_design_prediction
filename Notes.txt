NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------

The S11 output and bandwidth are dependent on Width, Epsilon and Substrate Height.

Also, the feed point defines the impedance on the patch. The more close the impedance of patch on that point is to the impedance of cable, the stronger is S11 parameter.

There are no other such parameters that needs to be considered.

Epsilon and SH defines the substrate material and its properties. Epsilon is the permeability of the material, and SH is the Substrate Height.

W and L are the Width and Length of rectangular antenna design.

FPW and FPL are the coordinate location of feeding point in terms of width and length respectively, considering origin at one corner.

S11 and OOF are the return loss and output frequency band at which the antenna is observed to be operating.

Bandwidth is the +3dB gain in the frequency band.
